AVERAGE.CMD

**** What do you think of the average trace? How many clock periods can you see? Can you identify the beginning and the end of the DES encipherment? 
**** Have a look at the summary the program printed. To which SBox does the target bit correspond? Is it correct? 
**** Note the best guess and the height of the DPA peak. What do you think of this height, compared to the average power trace? 
**** Note also the index of this maximum. What do you think of it?



DPA.CMD

**** The red trace is the one with the highest peak, the one corresponding to the found best guess. All the other 63 DPA traces are plotted in blue. What do you think of this? Do you think we correctly guessed 6 bits of the last round key? Why?

**** Here is an example of what you could try to do as a starting point: use the provided DPA program example ('dpa') 32 times on the 32 different target bits. Have a look at some DPA traces with 'gnuplot' if you like. For each of the 32 experiments fill a line in the table printed on the back side of the DES chart (the line corresponding to the example above is already filled).

Remark: because it takes some time to run all these 32 experiments, join your efforts. Then, analyze your results: for the same group of 6 bits you should have 4 best guesses. They should be identical. Is it the case? Look at the maximum amplitudes and at the maximum positions. What do you think of this attack? Is it a Hamming distance or a Hamming weight one? Do you have ideas to make it more efficient? If yes, keep them for you (it's a competition, after all) and test them.
